Tablero
=======

This is an experiment at creating a whiteboard using the Canvas API and SignalR for .NET. 

It is written as a jQuery plugin so you can really use it as a stand alone, very rudimentary, painting tool.

I personally use it with my daughters so I can teach them math remotely: They go to my personal website and everything
I pain on the screen, they can see on their screen. That way, I can see how they tackle a problem and get to the solution.
If they make a mistake, I can intervene and show them how is done.
